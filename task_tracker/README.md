# TaskTracker

An app to manage personal tasks.

Users can sign up for an account on the user's page. This doesn't 
require any authentication because it is the entry point to the app.
Once they create an account they can log in and then create tasks
on the tasks page (the index). They can edit existing tasks, but they 
cannot reassign tasks, to prevent users from incorrectly assigning tasks
to other users. At the moment, as per the instructions, a user can assign
tasks to any other user.
